# This script resolves the references indicated by <tabRef>, <graphRef>
# and <dataValuesRef> tags in the XML files in the "dashboards", "tabs",
# "graphs", and "data" directory.
# 
# Usage, e.g:
# 
#     ./bin/deref ./dashboards/dashboard2.xml
# 
# The output, which is written to standard output, is a version
# of the input file in which all the <tabRef>, <graphRef>
# and <dataValuesRef> tags have been replaced with the contents
# of the files they refer to, recursively.
#
# This script looks for files in subdirectories of the current
# directory (current when the script is run) named `tabs`,
# `graphs`, and `data`; so it has to be run in a directory that
# contains those subdirs (and files in them).
